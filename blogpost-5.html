<h1 id="things-to-keep-in-mind-passwords">Things to Keep in Mind:
Passwords</h1>
<p>Passwords are the medieval knight guards of our time. Protecting us
from foreign internet attacks and data manipulation. Your machine is
like your royal domain and is just as likely to get hijacked as any
other domain. You wouldn’t rely on one guard to protect everything in
your domain because once he is struck, the rest of your domain is under
attack and can be easily accessed. Keep in mind your domain has all your
personal information and importantly your bank information (I know that
banks didn’t exist in the medieval times, please bare with me). For the
same reason, you wouldn’t rely on using the same password for all of
your accounts because once that password is discovered every one of your
accounts becomes very vulnerable.</p>
<p>If you’re like me a couple years ago, you probably do this. If you
do, you should probably go change some of your passwords. Before you do
that, here are a couple tips when creating passwords.</p>
<h2 id="stay-organized">Stay Organized</h2>
<p>It is super important to stay organized. A lot of people think to
write their passwords down on sticky notes or notebooks which can be
very risky. However, as long as the passwords you write down are stored
in safe places and taken care of this, you should be set. You could also
put your passwords in a text file on your phone or your computer and
you’d want to make sure the text files are obviously labeled. You want
to be discreet and oddly specific. Get weird with it. You also don’t
want to make sure you make too many passwords for different accounts so
you’re going to have to do some triage.</p>
<h2 id="triage">Triage</h2>
<p>Triage is the determination of urgency by the degree of
vulnerability. In this context, it involves making different passwords
for accounts that are super high risk if hacked and keeping the same
password for accounts that wouldn’t matter so much if they got hacked.
For example, it would be ideal if your bank account and email password
were different from your instagram or tik-tok account. It would decrease
the number of passwords to remember if you used the same password for
the accounts you’re least worried about getting hacked. In other words,
you want to be allocating your password security.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there and happy developing.</p>
