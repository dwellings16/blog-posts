<h1 id="websites-vs.-web-apps">Websites vs. Web Apps</h1>
<p>The difference between websites and web apps are crucial to our
understanding of fullstack developing. However, distinguishing between
the two might not be as straight forward as you think. Luckily, there
are few concrete differences to help you on your way as a developer.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-differences">conceptual differences</h2>
<p>One of the main differences between the two is what they are
conceptually. In other words; what purpose do they serve? The main
purpose of a website is to convey information to the user. The user can
search things and click links and URL’s to send them in the direction
they would need to resolve the answers to their questions. Meanwhile, a
web application’s main purpose is the interaction between the user and
the app itself. Navigating an app would is a more active process than a
navigating a website. If we compare websites and applications to other
media, a website would compare more to a build-your-own-adventure novel
while an applications compares more to an open world RPG video game.
Let’s take the Clarkson University Website and the Clarkson Moodle
application, for example. Moodle is a dominantly interactive experience.
Students can upload their schoolwork via dropbox, message students and
professors, and participate in typed forums. You create an account to
let students and professors know who you are. It is <em>you</em>
interacting within the app and know where else. Meanwhile, if you wanted
to reach out to a professor on the Clarkson website, you would need to
read, type into the search bar, and click their hyperlinked email
address that sends you to your default email text box. That’s about as
interactive as it gets. Rather, the website allows users to learn what
different majors and programs are offered, what campus life is like,
where to book a visit, where the hell Potsdam, New York is, etc.</p>
<h2 id="interactivity-vs.-passivity">Interactivity vs. Passivity</h2>
<p>The one thing that will allow you to gain a better understanding of
the difference between apps and websites is knowing interactivity
vs. passivity. Those are pretty easy to understand. There are some
really well known web apps that many of us use everyday. Most if not all
social media is a web application, because they are insanely interactive
to a point of addiction in many of their users. It’s less likely that
you’ll bump into someone addicted to a website, unless we’re talking
about Porn sites, which could be debated heavily on whether they are
considered applications vs. websites. However, I’m not going to get into
that, but it’s definitely some food for thought to leave you with.</p>
