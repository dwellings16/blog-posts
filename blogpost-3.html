Keep In Mind: Behavior-Driven Development</h1>
<p>To truly understand whether your team’s product is working, it must
be tested by people. More specifically, people who aren’t as tech-savvy
as the developing team. The less technologically skilled, the better.
It’s ideal to gather a large quantity of people from a diverse range of
backgrounds and have them test the app, site, product etc. Once given
the user a task to complete, then feedback from each user is analyzed.
Although written and verbal feedback is helpful, it has the potential to
be unreliable or dishonest.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to pay close attention to when
testing is the body language of the user. Watch facial expressions,
micro-aggressions, crying, smashing the keyboard across their knees or
something of the nature. In all seriousness, the behavior of the user is
very valuable when testing your team’s product.</p>
<p>I now preach the importance of Behavior-Driven Development because I
made a few mistakes when carrying out testing for a mobile app I created
for a local movie theater. I used a basic google survey that I had the
users fill out once they completed their instructed task. I made the
mistake of leaving the room to give them space and relieve pressure when
testing. This would have been a smart move if I was able to monitor body
language from a distance, but I didn’t and it wasn’t until I sat down to
right my report that those observations would have been helpful. It’s
important to mention that I only tested four other people and it was for
a UX class, so most of the testers were pretty tech savvy. 75% of my
feedback on the google surveys was way too positive and lacked any
critique or additional comments. I did have one student give me great
constructive feedback which I relied on for my report.</p>
<p>The example I gave might not have been very convincing as the sample
was so small and similar. However, I took away a lot from this
experience and think that it is worth sharing to those interested in UX
testing and what goes into it.</p>
