<h1 id="things-to-keep-in-mind-lamp-stacks">Things to Keep in Mind: LAMP
Stacks</h1>
<p>Setting up a LAMP stack can be very intimidating for developers who
have never messed around with PHPmyadmin and developing on local
servers.</p>
<p>Let’s back up a bit, LAMP stands for Linux(the OS), Apache(the
server), MySQL(the database) and PHP(the code). LAMP stacks are very
popular among the devloping world and are used to develop web
applications and websites. It’s a very reliable framework for many
things, such as development on a domain.</p>
<p>I recently stood up a LAMP stack on my Domain and ran into a few
issues that caused me way more trouble than it should have. A lot of
developing for new developers is code not working and commands from the
CLI showing errors for reasons that seem inexplicable and then realizing
you didn’t use sudo or you’re sending commands from root when you were
suppose to command from a user you created. If you’re like me, you might
have installed multiple versions of the same application and your
computer gets so confused that it just stops running commands.
Hopefully, you don’t get to that point. Without further ado, here are a
few things to keep in mind when setting up a LAMP stack.</p>
<h2 id="sudo-if-all-else-fails">Sudo if All Else Fails</h2>
<p>One of the most important things I learned when setting up my LAMP
stack was the value of sudo commands from the CLI. Unfortunately, this
one is for the IOS developers. If you develop from a Windows machine, I
feel the utmost sympathy for you. There were so many times, where I
would type in a command and it would give me errors, type back “sorry”
in a very passive aggressive way, or just not give me anything. This was
incredibly frustrating for awhile and resulted in my desire to give up
developing forever, until I discovered the sudo command. If all else
fails, just put sudo in front of your command, type in your passord, and
that should work. Although, it might not be the issue everytime so don’t
rely to heavily on it.</p>
<h2 id="make-sure-your-commanding-from-the-right-user">Make sure your
commanding from the right user</h2>
<p>Another issue I ran into was installing PHPmyadmin and the issue was
really annoying, but only needed one tiny fix that I wasn’t paying
attention to. When installing PHPmyadmin, you have to create a user and
then command from that user and switch out of root. I was trying to
devlop in root and not in the user I had created. If you try to develop
from root PHPmyadmin will not show up on your domain or where ever you
plan to use it.</p>
<h2 id="dont-overinstall-out-of-frustration">don’t overinstall out of
frustration</h2>
<p>If you install the same applications, databases, servers, etc
multiple times that’s going to cause more issues. I became very
frustated many times when I would install something and the steps that
came after the installation wouldn’t work. My first thought was to keep
installing the application until the steps worked. In retrospect, it
screwed with my process when I moved on with later steps and resulted in
a deep search for my installations and a purge of the duplicates.</p>
<p>I hope these tips are helpful. Don’t be like me and make sure you
read over documents carefully. Happy developing.</p>
